(1)Importing Modules:
The code imports the Tk class from the tkinter module, as well as other elements like Label and mainloop for GUI components.
ttk module is imported for enhanced widget styles.

(2)Creating Tkinter Window:
A Tkinter window (root) is created with the title 'Clock'.

(3)Time Function:
The time function is defined to update the label with the current time.
It uses the strftime function to format the system time as '%H:%M:%S %p' (hours, minutes, seconds, AM/PM).
The label (lbl) is configured to display the formatted time.
The after method schedules the time function to run every 1000 milliseconds (1 second).

(4)Styling the Label Widget:
The label (lbl) is created with a specified font, background color ('purple'), and foreground color ('white').

(5)Placing the Clock:
The label is placed at the center of the Tkinter window using pack.

(6)Updating Time:
The time function is called initially to set up the clock.
The mainloop method starts the Tkinter event loop, allowing the clock to continuously update.
When you run this script, it will create a Tkinter window displaying a digital clock with a purple background and white text. The time is updated every second.
